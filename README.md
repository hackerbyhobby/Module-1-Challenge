# TITLE - Module 1 Challenge
AI-Case-Study 

## Overview and Origin
Deepgram is an automatic speech recognition startup that uses end-to-end deep learning technology to train speech models to learn under complex, real-world conditions—regardless of customers’ unique vocabulary, accents, product names, and acoustic environments (*1).  CEO Scott Stephenson, came up with the idea for Deepgram while researching the creation of dark matter in a bunker two miles underground as a Ph.D. student. In the few hours that weren’t devoted to his research, Scott recorded audio from his life, 24,7, and realized there wasn’t a tool available that would help process his recordings and pinpoint valuable timestamps. (*1)

* When was the company incorporated?
2015 (*2)

* Who are the founders of the company?
Noah Shutty, Scott Stephenson (*3)

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
CEO Scott Stephenson, came up with the idea for Deepgram while researching the creation of dark matter in a bunker two miles underground as a Ph.D. student. In the few hours that weren’t devoted to his research, Scott recorded audio from his life, 24,7, and realized there wasn’t a tool available that would help process his recordings and pinpoint valuable timestamps. (*1)

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Y Combinator & other seed funding (*2).  They have raised a total of 85.9 million to date (*3).

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
They’re trying to solve speech recognition regardless of customers’ unique vocabulary, accents, product names, and acoustic environments (*1). 
> “ASR is not solved,” Scott Stephenson, co-founder and CEO of Deepgram, explained in an interview. “It’s solved for specific data sets but with noisy accented call data, any service will do a poor job with it." (*10)

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Intended customers are any companies that need to solve speech recognition, using an API.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? Deepgram's deep learning speech recognition system searches for keywords in transcripts by sound and text within audio and video files, used for transcribing calls, meetings, and voicemails for searchable notes,providing businesses with a fast, high accuracy speech-to-text on an easy-to-use API. (*3). It’s not that competitors cannot offer this service, but the difference is that Deepgram is nearly 30% more accurate, over 30x faster, and 3x more affordable than it’s next biggest competitor, speechmatics. (*4)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing - you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Deepgram uses Nova-2 and Nova for transforming and transcribing speech, Enhanced for reducing word error rates, Base for large transcription volumes and high accuracy timestamps, and Deepgram Whisper Cloud for transcribing pre-recorded audio files. (*5)

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
Deepgram operates in the speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP) industry.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5-10 years?
Current trends in natural language processing (NLP) include the increasing adoption of NLP solutions in the healthcare, finance, and customer service industries, among others. There has also been a shift towards using deep learning techniques for NLP tasks, which has led to improved accuracy and efficiency. Another trend is the development of multilingual NLP models that can understand and process multiple languages. (*6)

* What are the other major companies in this field?
Speechmatics, AssemblyAI, Google Cloud’s speech to text, Amazon transcribe, Microsoft Azure speech, IBM Watson speech to text, Nuance communications

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Since going to market, Deepgram has amassed customers across the call center, retail and tech industries, and partnered with some of the leading large-scale communication and conferencing providers. (*7) 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
Pre-recording processing, Accuracy (WER), and cost per pre-recorded minute and streaming per minute. (*8) Deepgram claims to be the leader in these areas. (*8, *9)


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
Deepgram claims to be performing better than their competitors in terms of performance and cost. (*8) (*9)

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I think they’re already doing a wonderful job. To improve, I’d suggest that they offer implementation consulting services that help make adoption of their solutions, much faster for customers. Many customers may not have an AI savvy tech team, and need help solving their speech conversion problems.


* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
I think it would benefit potential customers because it would shorten the learning curve, and because they know their product better than anyone else.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
It would be a service (consulting) and it would use their own technologies.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
They’re appropriate because it is leveraging their own tech stack to help serve their customers with expedited implementation of their own solutions.
